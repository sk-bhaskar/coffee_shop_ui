🌟 Excited to Share My Latest Flutter Project! ☕📱

I recently built a Coffee Shop UI using Flutter, designed to provide a smooth and visually appealing user experience for coffee lovers! 🍵✨

💡 Features:
✅ Beautiful UI: A sleek and modern interface for browsing different coffee types.
✅ Dynamic Item Display: Uses a list of coffee images to showcase different beverages.
✅ Smooth Navigation: Implemented Navigator for seamless screen transitions.
✅ Asset Management: Efficiently handles images using Flutter’s asset management system.

Here’s a quick preview of the app! 📸👇
